         to %temp%\VBCSCompiler\AnalyzerAssemblyLoader. As such, we embed our original path in our File Description,
         so we can lookup all the structs we need to generate native implementations for. $(SolutionDir) can't be used,
         as depending on how we're being compiled, it may not be defined! -->

    /// operations do not complete until the debugger calls <see cref="ICorDebugController.Continue"/>, and then receives
    /// an <see cref="ICorDebugManagedCallback.EvalComplete"/> callback. If you need to use the evaluation functionality
    /// without allowing other threads to run, suspend the threads by using either <see cref="ICorDebugController.SetAllThreadsDebugState"/>
    /// or <see cref="ICorDebugController.Stop"/> before calling <see cref="ICorDebugController.Continue"/>. Because user
    /// code is running when the evaluation is in progress, any debug events can occur, including class loads and breakpoints.
    /// The debugger will receive callbacks, as normal, for these events. The state of the evaluation will be seen as part
    /// of the inspection of the normal program state. The stack chain will be a CHAIN_FUNC_EVAL chain (see the "CorDebugStepReason"
    /// enumeration and the <see cref="ICorDebugChain.GetReason"/> method). The full debugger API will continue to operate

             * COM marshalling, you're not going to be able to ignore the rules. And since the managed/unmanaged callback threads will occur on secondary threads, attempting to use
             * any COM objects you already have from within a callback thread (which may be necessary in order to Continue, etc) will cause the CLR to explode. Thus, we enforce
